# LIBFT

Libft is a School 42 project. The purpose of this project is to create own C library.
At 21, students are not allowed to use library functions (no strlen, strdup, bzero etc.). My challenge was to create a personal C library.

Allowed functions are malloc free & write. Everything else is forbidden for the mandatory submission.
